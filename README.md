## Questions

1. I want to report a bug.

    Please use GitHub issues.

2. I want a feature.

    Chances are I'm too busy to work on features I don't personally need,
    so pull requests are strongly encouraged.

3. Why not aegisub?

    Because it doesn't cover my needs, it's too convoluted and its development
    is too slow.

4. Windows builds?

    You can find a Windows build for bubblesub [here](https://github.com/Luni-4/bubblesub/tree/windows).  
    I don't maintain it, so please contact the current developer if you find some issue.

5. Versioning? PyPI?

    I don't say no, maybe in the future, if the project gets more popular.
    For now, `git master` is the way to go.
