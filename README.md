## Questions

1. I want to report a bug.

    Please use GitHub issues.

2. I want a feature.

    Chances are I'm too busy to work on features I don't personally need,
    so pull requests are strongly encouraged.

3. Why not aegisub?

    Because it doesn't cover my needs, it's too convoluted and its development
    is too slow.

4. Windows builds?

    This is a hobby project and wrestling with Windows to have it compile a
    single C dependency library isn't my idea of a well-spent afternoon.
    It should be possible with MSYS2.

5. Versioning? PyPI?

    I don't say no, maybe in the future, if the project gets more popular.
    For now, `git master` is the way to go.
